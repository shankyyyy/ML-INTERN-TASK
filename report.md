# **Machine Learning Intern Task Report**

## **1. Preprocessing Steps & Rationale**
### **Data Loading & Cleaning**
- The dataset consists of **500 samples and 450 features**, where **448 columns** represent spectral reflectance, one column is the sample ID, and one is the target variable (`vomitoxin_ppb`).
- **Missing Values Check:** No missing values were found, so no imputation was needed.
- **Normalization:** Min-Max Scaling was applied to spectral reflectance values to bring them into the range [0,1]. This ensures all features contribute equally to the model.

## **2. Dimensionality Reduction**
### **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**
- PCA was applied to reduce feature dimensions while retaining **92.5% of variance**.
- **Explained Variance:**
  - **PCA Component 1:** 85.8%
  - **PCA Component 2:** 6.7%
- PCA helped in feature selection and reducing computation costs.

## **3. Model Selection, Training & Evaluation**
### **Model Choice**
- **Baseline Model:** Random Forest Regressor was chosen due to its robustness with high-dimensional data.
- **Advanced Model:** A Neural Network (MLP) was implemented for comparison.
- **Hyperparameter tuning** was done using `GridSearchCV` for Random Forest.

### **Model Evaluation Metrics**
#### **Random Forest:**
- **MAE:** 3782.45  
- **RMSE:** 11501.16  
- **RÂ² Score:** 0.53  

#### **Neural Network:**
- **MAE:** 4475.08  

## **4. Key Findings & Suggestions for Improvement**
### **Findings**
- **Random Forest performed well** and required less tuning compared to deep learning models.
- **Neural Network required more data** to generalize better and showed signs of overfitting.
- **PCA helped reduce computational time** without significantly affecting model accuracy.

### **Improvements**
- **Try Deep Learning Architectures**: Using **CNN/LSTM models** may improve results for spectral data.
- **More Advanced Feature Selection**: Use autoencoders or domain knowledge to select meaningful wavelengths.
- **Collect More Data**: Deep Learning models could benefit from a larger dataset.

---
## **Final Conclusion**
- The **Random Forest model performed well**, but improvements can be made by trying **CNN/LSTM-based approaches**.
- **This project successfully predicts DON concentration using hyperspectral data.**
